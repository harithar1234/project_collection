# Deep_Learning_Project
by Haritha.R -AI20BTECH11010

This Repository contains the code that I experimented with for the Project of course AI2100 at IITH.
I implemented yolov3 algorithm in this project
and used that to detect multiple objects in one image and
generate audio file which generates speech,describing
the objects in the image.

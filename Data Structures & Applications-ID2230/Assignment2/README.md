Assignment 2: User authentication

In this assignment, the goal is to take a set of stored usernames and passwords, and then create a hash table for them.

Once the hash table is created, the password corresponding to a username can be located quickly for authentication.

For the purpose of this assignment, we will use the attached file input.csv as the only input file for testing.

The file is here: input.csv 
 

Input Format: The input consists of a file in csv format (comma separated values) with each line being in the form username, password.

Output: Your program should do the following:

(a) first prompt the user for their username: if the username is not found in your hash table, then your program will report a "Name Not Found" error and terminate.

(b) if the username is found in the hash table, ask the user for their password. If the password is correct, report "Login successful", otherwise report "Incorrect password".

Note that there's only a single test case.
